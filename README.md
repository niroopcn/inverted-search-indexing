# inverted-search-indexing

This project dives into an Indexing technique called Inverted Indexing.
A data structure which stores mapping from words to documents or set of documents i.e. directs you from word to document.

Ex:
hello --> file1      
sky --> file1, file3
coffee --> file2
hey --> file2
greetings --> file3      

The purpose of storing an index is to optimize speed and performance in finding relevant documents for a search query. Without an index, the search engine would scan every document in the corpus, which would require considerable time and computing power.
